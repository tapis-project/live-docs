# Tapis live docs app

Run `npm install` to download packages and build the site.

After that you can serve the built files through a proxy or a simple python server shown here:

```bash
python -m http.server 9999
```
Once running, point a browser to localhost:9999 to view the local built live-docs page.

To iterate, change files, rebuild, and relaunch the server.
